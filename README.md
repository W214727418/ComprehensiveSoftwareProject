This is one of my first nodejs codes that uses ejs and connects to a database.
It was made during the time where I was still in my beginning stages of learning how to code in nodejs.
As such, the code is an absolute jumbled mess, but hey, at least it works.
Since then, I learned a lot more about nodejs and I've created another unrelated project which is leagues better than this.\

I could fix a lot about this code, but the deadline is today so I don't have enough time.
